## About Me ⚡

Born in France and raised in the U.S., I come from a diverse cultural background with broad interests. After spending over a decade bringing products to market as an industrial designer, I transitioned into business analytics to uncover the patterns behind successful decisions. Now an MBA-trained analyst and design educator, I teach the next generation of designers to think critically and analytically while exploring the intersection of design, technology, and data. This GitHub is where I experiment, build, and share tools that turn complex problems into simple solutions.
